<p align="justify">At SAJC, we believe that we are &lsquo;One Family Unbroken&rsquo; and this means that our connection with the Saints family does not end upon graduation. Former students continue to give back to the college in various capacities, inspiring students to pay it forward and help future generations of Saints.</p>
<p align="justify">The SAJC Alumni contributes in various ways, providing guidance and support for current students in all aspects of their JC life. Former students return to share study tips and provide consultations for the current students and also help out during CCA sessions where they would help to coach the current students. Some CCAs that enjoy this collaboration between past and present students are Football, Dance and Concert Band. Lastly, the Alumni has also helped in preparing our Saints for life beyond JC such as sharing about university life and career options, as well as providing work-shadowing opportunities for JC1 Saints.</p>
<p align="justify">Below are two screenshots of our former students who readily stepped forward to offer academic support to our Saints during the Circuit Breaker period in 2020 via online platforms.</p>

<p align="justify">The SAJC Mentors are members of the college Chaplaincy which provides pastoral care to the SAJC Community. As mentors, they interact with students on the ground during daily school activities like PE lessons and CCA sessions. Along the way, the mentors serve to help and guide Saints through life in college.</p>

<p align="justify">SAJCâ€™s Valedictorian for 2021 is Tham Si Hui Charis. As the President of the 42nd Student Council, Charis was actively involved in helming many different school activities. Charis has been awarded the MOE Teaching Award and will be pursuing her studies at NTU-NIE in August 2021.</p>

<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Geography?</strong></h4>
<p>Geography is the study of Earth’s landscapes, peoples, places and environments.
It bridges the social sciences with the natural sciences and puts the understanding
of social and physical processes within the context of places, regions
and scales. In ‘A’ Level Geography, students will acquire an appreciation
of the uniqueness of different types of natural environments in the physical
world and places in the social world. Students will learn of the interactions
and interdependence between natural environments, societies and cultures
at various scales; as well as the evolution of landscapes and development
of issues over time through geographical perspectives. ‘A’ Level Geography
helps students to be more socially and environmentally sensitive, informed
and responsible citizens.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is Geography taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>Like other subjects taught in the College, lessons are structured using
a lecture-tutorial system, in which conceptual knowledge is taught during
lectures and their applications are practiced in tutorials. Lecture notes
and readings are part and parcel of the process, as well as application
of learned content on practice questions in tutorials. Learning also takes
place outside the boundaries of a lecture theatre or a classroom, when
students undertake tasks to learn the necessary steps and processes that
geographers use to “do” Geography. Otherwise known as Geographical Investigation
(GI), in SAJC fieldwork is also a key element that forms a part of our
programme here for Geography students.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Geography?</strong></h4>
<p>Careful reading and thinking through of given materials is a must, followed
by active application of learned concepts and examples through the help
of question practice. Deep and entrenched understanding of the geographical
concepts comes only with consistent hard work, and in the long run will
yield positive outcomes as well as learning experience. Seeking help from
teachers to clarify understanding of what has been taught is key. Finally,
having a genuine interest in the subject will help ensure that the journey
embarked on is a sustainable one over the course of two years.</p>

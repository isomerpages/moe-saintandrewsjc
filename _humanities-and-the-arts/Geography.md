<h4><strong>1. What is &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Geography?</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">Geography is the study of Earth&rsquo;s landscapes, peoples, places and environments. It bridges the social sciences with the natural sciences and puts the understanding of social and physical processes within the context of places, regions and scales. In &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Geography, students will acquire an appreciation of the uniqueness of different types of natural environments in the physical world and places in the social world. Students will learn of the interactions and interdependence between natural environments, societies and cultures at various scales; as well as the evolution of landscapes and development of issues over time through geographical perspectives. &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Geography helps students to be more socially and environmentally sensitive, informed and responsible citizens.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is Geography taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">Like other subjects taught in the College, lessons are structured using a lecture-tutorial system, in which conceptual knowledge is taught during lectures and their applications are practiced in tutorials. Lecture notes and readings are part and parcel of the process, as well as application of learned content on practice questions in tutorials. Learning also takes place outside the boundaries of a lecture theatre or a classroom, when students undertake tasks to learn the necessary steps and processes that geographers use to &ldquo;do&rdquo; Geography. Otherwise known as Geographical Investigation (GI), in SAJC fieldwork is also a key element that forms a part of our programme here for Geography students.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Geography?</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">Careful reading and thinking through of given materials is a must, followed by active application of learned concepts and examples through the help of question practice. Deep and entrenched understanding of the geographical concepts comes only with consistent hard work, and in the long run will yield positive outcomes as well as learning experience. Seeking help from teachers to clarify understanding of what has been taught is key. Finally, having a genuine interest in the subject will help ensure that the journey embarked on is a sustainable one over the course of two years.</p>

<h4><strong>1. What is &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Art?</strong></h4>
<p>The &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Art syllabi are designed to provide students with an in-depth study and provide opportunities at the pre-university level to broaden their engagement in the visual arts.</p>
<p>Students taking H1 Art will investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the study of artists and artworks (Study of Visual Arts - SOVA). Visual literacy skills, such as perception of and response to visual images, as well as critical analysis of visual information, will also be developed. H1 Art does not include a practical component.</p>
<p>The H2 Art syllabus emphasises the development of visual literacy as well as critical and creative thinking by encouraging personal responses to art making and art appreciation. The development of abilities to create, respond to and interpret artworks is well integrated into the contents of two components: Studio Practice (practical) and the Study of Visual Arts (theory).</p>
<p>In &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Art, students will cultivate deeper understanding and appreciation of visual arts within social and cultural contexts. In addition, it encourages experimentation and innovation through exploration and lays the foundation for lifelong interest in the visual arts.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is Art taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>Lessons are structured using a lecture-tutorial system. For the theoretical component of the Study of Visual Arts (H1/H2), students respond to and interpret artworks. These lessons aim to nurture visual literacy by taking a systematic approach to Art criticism through formal analysis &ndash; description, analysis, interpretation and evaluation. Students will develop the vocabulary to discuss works of art and be able to appreciate Art and its role in society. In the practical component of Studio Practice (H2), students will have access to diverse materials and resources to develop aesthetic sensitivity, creativity, critical thinking and reflection through a variety of arts activities. During the practical modules, students are encouraged to explore and experiment with a variety of media and techniques providing first-hand experiences that are visual, tactile, oral and literary. They will acquire skills such as research, idea development, personal reflection and evaluation in the process of creating artworks through the preparatory studies, which are an integral and important part of the Studio Practice. In addition, students learn to think through issues and problems and develop their abilities to translate ideas into artworks.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Art?</strong></h4>
<p>Students must show a genuine interest in Art. They must have a passion for Art and be a self-disciplined individual. As our Art programme places equal emphasis on both the practical and theoretical aspects of art making, students are encouraged to explore their thoughts, feelings and ideas through a variety of art practices and processes. They must come prepared with their research, exploration and the willingness to accept criticism through art critiques. Students will acquire skills such as idea development, personal reflection and evaluation through the process of creating and discussing artworks. With SOVA, students must be keen to develop their visual literacy through the critical analysis and appraisal of artists done through critical readings, discussions and question practices.</p>

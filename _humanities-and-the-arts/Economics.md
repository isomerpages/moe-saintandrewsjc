<h4><strong>1. What is &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Economics?</strong></h4>
<p>Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It studies the problem of scarcity and how individuals, firms, governments, and nations make choices on allocating resources to satisfy their wants and needs. It is the study of decision-making and how people respond to incentives. The study of individual decisions is called Microeconomics while the study of the economy as a whole is called Macroeconomics.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level Economics, students will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental economic concepts, theories and principles and methods of analysis</li>
<li>Tools and methods of economic reasoning to explain and analyse economic issues, and to evaluate perspectives and decisions of economic agents</li>
<li>How to read critically from a variety of sources to gain information about the changing economic activities and policies at national and international levels</li>
<li>How to make well-reasoned economic arguments to arrive at rational and considered decisions</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. How is Economics taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>The SAJC Economics department adopts a blended learning model where students will be required to view online lectures and complete online activities before tutorial lessons. Tutors will follow up in tutorial lessons with class discussions that will equip students with the skills required to think like an economist.</p>
<p>SAJC provides comprehensive lecture notes that will enable students to learn the necessary economic concepts, theories and principles outlined in the syllabus. Tutorial worksheets include guided questions that will reinforce the concepts taught in lectures and facilitate the development of the analytical and evaluative skills required to think like an economist. Students are expected to come prepared to class by reading the lecture notes and viewing the relevant lecture videos beforehand. This will optimise the tutorial time where teachers can clarify doubts and help students apply their economic knowledge and tools of economic reasoning to different contexts.</p>
<p>There are regular bite-sized assessment opportunities throughout the year where teachers provide feedback to students on their learning. Revision packages which comprise past-year examination questions with suggested answers are provided to help students prepare for the A Level exams. Students are encouraged to arrange to meet their tutors for consultation sessions to clarify their doubts.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Economics?</strong></h4>
<p>The economist&rsquo;s view of the world and economic thinking can be rather abstract, and it is very likely that you will find it to be different from the way you are used to thinking. It is therefore important that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand that you cannot simply memorise notes provided to you</li>
<li>Read your lecture notes and view lecture videos</li>
<li>Read widely, keep abreast of current issues and apply economic theories to things happening around you</li>
<li>Attempt tutorial questions (and other practice questions) diligently so that you are able to apply your thinking skills to a wide range of questions</li>
<li>Ask questions in class if you don&rsquo;t understand and participate in class discussions</li>
<li>Challenge theories and consider assumptions; evaluate what you read and hear</li>
</ul>

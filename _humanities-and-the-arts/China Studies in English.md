<h4><strong>1. What is &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level H1 China Studies in English?</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>China Studies in English focuses on the transformation of China since 1978 and its future. It allows students to develop the relevant knowledge and critical thinking skills to pursue a holistic understanding of contemporary China and to be cognisant of larger global trends. In the long run, it seeks to enable students to potentially contribute in their own capacity to further Singapore-China interactions.</p>

<h4><strong>What can I learn from China Studies in English?</strong></h4>
<p>The issues-based approach provides focus for the discussion of the developments in contemporary China. It supports and offers opportunities for constructivist teaching and learning as the study of issues will provide students with a way to thoughtfully consider how individuals and institutions in a society interact and relate to each other, and give them a meaningful way of using knowledge from relevant sources. It also requires students to utilise critical thinking skills such as reflective thinking and drawing conclusions through analysing different sources of information.</p>

<p>The two issues (&lsquo;State-society relations in China&rsquo; and &lsquo;China as a global power&rsquo;) serve to guide discourse in the key knowledge dimensions in China Studies in English which involves politics, society, economy and international relations.</p>

Due to the dynamic and contemporary nature of the content, we are able to use very current materials (online or in print) to make our lessons more relevant and interesting.

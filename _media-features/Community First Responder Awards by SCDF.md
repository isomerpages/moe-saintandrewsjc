<p align="justify">We are so proud of our Saints who have chosen to step up to serve the needs of the community, even in the most unexpected circumstances. Both Zoe and Jason have placed the needs of others before themselves and through this episode, proven to be a blessing to the community.</p>
<p align="justify">This has certainly given us motivation to continue our work in SAJC: to mould every Saint into a Servant Leader. We look forward to more of such stories of courage and bravery!</p>

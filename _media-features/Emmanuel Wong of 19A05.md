<p>&ldquo;It is truly more blessed to give than to receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was what Emmanuel Wong from 19A05 had to say when asked about his journey towards the &lsquo;A&rsquo; Levels.</p>
<p>Being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), gearing up for the &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level examinations was fraught with many personal challenges. These challenges were exacerbated due to Covid-19 as the pandemic hit his family&rsquo;s source of income and the two-month lockdown heightened family tensions. Emmanuel did not have a conducive place to study and battled anxiety as the examinations loomed nearer. With support from his teachers, the school counsellor and the school&rsquo;s chaplaincy team who found him housing at St Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Emmanuel was able to find his footing and complete his &lsquo;A&rsquo; Levels successfully. Emmanuel scored A&rsquo;s for his H2 subjects (English Literature, History and Economics), General Paper and Project Work, as well as a C for H1 Mathematics.</p>
<p>The support that Emmanuel has received drives him to extend the same care and concern for others. He currently mentors children at St Andrew&rsquo;s House, facilitating student activities and caring for the students&rsquo; well-being. Emmanuel&rsquo;s story is one of resilience in face of adversity. We wish Emmanuel the very best as he strive towards his ambition to do policy-planning with the Ministry of Social and Family Development.</p>

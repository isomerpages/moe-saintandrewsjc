<p>Servant Leadership focuses on serving others before all else. Character development is the bedrock upon which all the other qualities are built upon.</p>
<p>At SAJC, character education comprises Social Emotional Learning (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management and responsible decision making.) and the internalisation of the College values (WISE and TRUE) in the lives of the Saints. These values are inculcated in our Character and Citizenship Education lessons, Scripture Readings, Chapel, Co-curricular Activities and school programmes.</p>
<p>However, the most powerful mode of learning for being an exemplary character is through role-modelling and seizing teachable moments in our daily interactions with students.</p>
<h4><strong>ChrySAlis</strong></h4>
<p>ChrySAlis is the College&rsquo;s signature Student Leadership Summit, jointly organised by the three St Andrew&rsquo;s Schools to provide opportunities for Student Leaders from the Student Council, Saints Advocate, Talent Development Programme and the various classes and CCAs to hone and demonstrate the habits and competencies of a Servant Leader. ChrySAlis is intended to provide student organisers and participants with the opportunity to be nurtured as servant leaders who lead and serve others, and also to become Skilled Communicators and Community Builders.</p>
<p>The name &lsquo;ChrySAlis&rsquo; was coined as a reference to the pupae stage of the metamorphosis of an egg into a butterfly. The focus of ChrySAlis is to inspire youths to make a difference through little actions, in their own communities.</p>
<p>ChrySAlis 2019, the sixth St Andrew&rsquo;s Village (SAV) Student Leadership Summit, was held from 3rd to 5th June 2019 at SAJC. The Summit brought together approximately 340 student leaders of different ages from the three SAV schools, Christ Church Secondary School, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, School of the Arts and St Margaret's Secondary School to collaborate, learn and grow together. The theme for 2019 was &lsquo;Be the Change&rsquo;, echoing the Summit&rsquo;s call for participants to become agents of change and actively make a difference, not only in our community, but also in our nation.</p>
<p>ChrySAlis 2019 was organised &lsquo;By Student Leaders, For Student Leaders&rsquo;. The Summit culminated in a community outreach programme &ndash; ComPASSIONity &ndash; which was SAV's inaugural partnership with the Housing and Development Board. During the pre-Summit brainstorming sessions, participants exchanged ideas to refine projects, with the aim of advocating for eco-friendliness and good neighbourliness in the Potong Pasir community. The projects were then carried out during ComPASSIONity where participants engaged with residents in Potong Pasir, to encourage them to be agents of change in the community.</p>

<h4><strong>SLEAD</strong></h4>
<p>Servant Leadership Education And Development (SLEAD) is SAJC&rsquo;s contextualised Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum. In line with our College&rsquo;s vision, it aims to provide a coherent focus to educating and developing every Saint to be a Servant Leader. In SAJC, we identify a Servant Leader as one who practices 3 key habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>A heart that desires to serve.</li>
<li>The head that learns to lead.</li>
<li>The hand that dares to act.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that these habits will help our Saints to learn to be exemplary in character, skilled communicators, holistic thinkers, and community builders &ndash; the Qualities of a Saint.</p>

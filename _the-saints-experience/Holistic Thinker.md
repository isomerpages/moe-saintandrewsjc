<p>It is widely agreed by educators and philosophers that the paramount purpose of education is to develop thinking individuals with a heart, who can make good decisions in their lives and work.</p>
<p>The "Holistic Thinker" is defined as one who makes good judgements by considering the big picture, innovates and provides practical solutions, envisions the future and is prepared for it. The four dimensions in Holistic Thinking advocated in SAJC are: Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, Caring Thinking and Forward Thinking.</p>
<p>All lessons and activities in SAJC have clear objectives which include thinking skills to be taught or reinforced.</p>
<h4><strong>Talent Development Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Talent Development Programme (TDP) serves to stretch our Saints by honing their 21st century competencies in information and communication skills, critical and inventive thinking, civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills. This is done through the provision of opportunities to develop and grow them in the domains of Scholastic Development, Servant Leadership Development and Expanding Perspectives.</p>
<p>Saints in the TDP can expect to gain knowledge and skills beyond the GCE A-level curriculum. To deepen and broaden the content taught in classrooms, TDP students in the Arts and Science stream have the opportunity to gain experiences offered under the Humanities Scholars Programme (HSP) and Science Scholars Programme (SSP) respectively. The table below lists some of the opportunities offered in both programmes.</p>

<p>Saints in the TDP are also equipped with skills and experiences to take on challenges confidently, as they grow to be Servant Leaders with the ability to leverage multiple perspectives. With the TDP experience, our Saints are better poised to strive for prestigious scholarships in both the public and private sectors.</p>

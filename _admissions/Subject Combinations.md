<h3>H3 Subjects</h3>
<p>H3 subjects have syllabi that are of a much higher level of difficulty.
Students offering H3 subjects must have the time and ability to manage
workload beyond their subject combination. A H3 subject must be offered
together with the corresponding subject at the H2 level.
<br>
<br>Students may offer H3 subjects in JC2 if they meet the following requirements
in their JC1 Promotional Examination: a distinction in the subject they
wish to pursue as H3, a minimum of a B grade in all other H2 subjects,
and a pass in their H1 subject.
<br>
<br>Students can apply for H3 subjects offered by one of the following MOE
partners involving tertiary institutions such as SMU, NUS or NTU.
<br>
<br>Alternatively, H3 subjects offered in SAJC include H3 Chemistry, H3 Mathematics,
H3 Physics, H3 Literature, H3 Geography and H3 History.

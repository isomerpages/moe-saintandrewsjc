<p>Students with Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination Results may
apply for admission into the college via the Ministry of Education Joint
Admissions Exercise (JAE).&nbsp;The JAE is typically conducted in January
after the release of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination results.
The JAE is conducted in three phases:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Registration Phase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting Phase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting Results Release Phase</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on the JAE process can be found on the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE Admissions</a></strong>&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>Information on appeals into the college will be published on the college
website near the release of JAE posting results.</p>
<p>Applicants seeking to gain admission into the college must meet the entry
criteria based on the L1R5 aggregate. This aggregate is calculated from
the results obtained in the&nbsp;previous yearâ€™s Singapore-Cambridge GCE
O-Level Examination.</p>

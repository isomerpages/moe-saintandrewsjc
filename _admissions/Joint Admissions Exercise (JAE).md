<p align="justify">Students with Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination Results may apply for admission into the college via the Ministry of Education Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE).&nbsp;The JAE is typically conducted in January after the release of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination results. The JAE is conducted in three phases:</p>

*   Registration Phase
*   Posting Phase
*   Posting Results Release Phase

More information on the JAE process can be found on the&nbsp;**[MOE Admissions](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae)**&nbsp;website.

Information on appeals into the college will be published on the college website near the release of JAE posting results.

<p align="justify">Applicants seeking to gain admission into the college must meet the entry criteria based on the L1R5 aggregate. This aggregate is calculated from the results obtained in the&nbsp;previous yearâ€™s Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination.</p>

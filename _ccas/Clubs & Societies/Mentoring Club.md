<p>The SAJC Mentoring Club mentors the younger members of the St Andrew&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>We are split into two groups: the Saint Andrew&rsquo;s Boarding House (SAH) group and the Saint Andrew&rsquo;s Junior School (SAJS) group.</p>
<p>Members of the SAH group make their way to the boarding house located near the Junior School to mentor primary school students who require after-school care. We help the students with their homework and conduct various enrichment activities such as arts and crafts, singing, storytelling and playing games.</p>
<p>Members of the SAJS group go to the Junior School to mentor the students on a one-to-one basis. We help the students with their homework and also conduct enrichment activities such as educational games sessions.</p>
<p>We meet every Wednesday, and invite you to join us if you enjoy interacting with young children!</p>

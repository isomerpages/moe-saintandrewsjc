<p>The SAJC Malay Cultural Society aims to provide a platform for its members to interact within a Malay community and learn more about the Malay culture and language in a fun and engaging manner. We are open to anyone who is keen to explore our culture!</p>
<p>Our members learn more about traditions, festivals, games, food and more. Visits to Kampong Buangkok and Pusat Warisan Melayu are the two popular places that allow for a meaningful experiential learning experience. We look forward to participating in national competitions such as &lsquo;Sahibba&rsquo; (Malay Scrabble) and Pesta Pantun (spontaneous poetry) too!</p>
<p>Ultimately, MCS is a platform where members get to bond with each other. Come and meet us during our sessions on Tuesdays!</p>

<p>The SAJC Badminton Team aims to sharpen our skills consistently in order to play competitively at any tournament. Our trainings focus on the following aspects: footwork, fitness, speed, accuracy, strategies and control. We emphasise on three core values in order to grow as a team: teamwork, sportsmanship, and resilience.</p>
<p>Through our rigorous training sessions and the bond we have with one another, we hope to improve our skills, strengthen our value of sportsmanship and promote team spirit! You&rsquo;ll find us hard at work during training sessions on Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>

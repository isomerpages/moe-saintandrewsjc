<p>Here at SAJC, rugby forms an integral part of the St Andrew&rsquo;s Village culture. Rugby is a traditional sport that has been played by many generations of St Andrew&rsquo;s boys. While rugby is considered a gentleman&rsquo;s sport, it is also known for its physicality and action. Some of our achievements include coming in Top 3 for the National School Games &lsquo;A&rsquo; Division Rugby Competition in 2019.</p>
<p>Training days are on Wednesdays and Fridays. We welcome anyone who is interested in the sport! But be prepared -- you&rsquo;re in for some serious exercise.</p>

<p>As members of the SAJC Chinese Orchestra, we are exposed to a mix of Western and Chinese instruments, such as the cello, zhong ruan, and gu zheng. Members are also free to choose any instrument they wish to be their trusted companion throughout their two years in the Orchestra. During our weekly practices, we get to play a variety of pieces, ranging from traditional Chinese music to English pop songs, under the guidance of our nurturing and experienced instructor.</p>
<p>CCA sessions are on Tuesday and Wednesdays. Do join us if you have an interest in learning a new instrument! No prior experience is required.</p>

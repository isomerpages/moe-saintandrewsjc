<p>At SAJC Concert Band, we believe that music-making should be enjoyable and only then, would it be entertaining and uplifting for our audiences. While the Band is a family that enjoys making music, we also strive for excellence in every performance. We know that by working together as a tight-knitted Band, we are growing and developing together, not only in our musicality, but also in our character. Besides participating in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival, the Band also organises annual performances to feature our hard work and progress to family and friends.</p>
<p>Practices are held on Wednesdays and Fridays, and along with our resident Conductor, Mr Marvin Khoo, the Band strives to help every member achieve their maximum potential, both as a musician and a student.</p>

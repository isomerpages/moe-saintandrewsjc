<p>The SAJC Dance Society is made up of dedicated members with a passion for dance, and we aim to awe and inspire our audience with performances ranging from elegant contemporary to vibrant hip-hop. We perform during major College events such as College Day, Open House, and &lsquo;Rapture&rsquo;, our CCA&rsquo;s biennial concert. Our CCA has managed to clinch the Certificate of Distinction for the biennial Singapore Youth Festival from 2013-2019.</p>
<p>Thinking of dancing with us? CCA sessions are held every Wednesday and Friday and we look forward to welcoming anyone with an interest in dance. No prior dance experience needed!</p>

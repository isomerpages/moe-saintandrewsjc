<h4><strong><u>Our Curriculum</u></strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department adopts a student-centric approach
in the delivery of our lessons. In planning our curriculum, we design schemes
of work that are current and relevant aligned to the new syllabus. As a
department, we adopt a wide range of teaching techniques to achieve deep
learning and the desired outcomes for MTL students. We motivate and empower
them to become active and self-directed learners, while setting meaningful
assignments and tasks, catered to differentiated levels, to help students
achieve mastery. Our students’ progress are monitored both formally (summative)
and informally (formative) through regular feedback on their assignments,
tasks, tests and examinations. Last but not least, we also emphasise on
a values-driven education for our students.</p>

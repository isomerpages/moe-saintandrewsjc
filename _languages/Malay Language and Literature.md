<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Malay Language and Literature?</strong></h4>
<p>The Malay Language and Literature (MLL) course aims to nurture students
to be cultural transmitters and Asian literature advocates with a deep
understanding of the Malay language, culture, values and ethos as well
as critical and creative global thinkers with cross-cultural understanding
and awareness.</p>
<p>In the language component, students will learn to write essays, comprehension,
vocabulary, and commentary writing. Here they are exposed to contemporary
prose to evaluate the themes in the given contexts and reflect how these
themes relate to themselves, their society, and the world. The process
would enhance students’ communication and writing skills, thereby creating
their own literary works.</p>
<p>In the literature component, students will appreciate and analyse novel,
short stories, poetry and drama. They will study works from the past and
present to develop their literary appreciation and writing skills. This
helps to develop cross-cultural understanding and awareness through study
of local and overseas literature texts written by the Malay community.
Students are also guided to analyse unseen texts that cultivates reflective
readers and critical learners through an exposure to a wider range of texts
and equipping students with the skills of critical literary analysis.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is MLL taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>Experiential learning is the main approach in the teaching and learning
of MLL. Students are exposed to the various pragmatic application of Malay
beyond the campus and the opportunity to engage with authors for the various
genres and the various literary organisations. Students learn from the
interactive nature of knowledge application with critical thinking and
the creative use of technology for collaborative learning.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can you do to prepare yourself for MLL in SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>Develop a sense of the Malay literary scene in Singapore and the region
through reading and exploring the Malay literary development and materials
both online and in print. Students can also attend Malay literary events
and festivities to be near local writers, enthusiasts and professionals.

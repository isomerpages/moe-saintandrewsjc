<p align="justify">Water Polo is a challenging sport that demands a lot from players in terms of ball-possession skills, shooting accuracy and swimming efficiency. At SAJC Water Polo, both our Boys and Girls teams train hard with the aim of having a competitive edge over others. Our Girls team has done our College proud and has achieved Top 4 placing for the National School Games &lsquo;A&rsquo; Division Water Polo Competitions in 2017, 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p align="justify">We welcome all water polo players who have a passion for the sport, and swimmers who would like to take up a new challenge to join the SAJC Water Polo Team! Our weekly trainings are on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at the Saint Andrew&rsquo;s Village pool.</p>

<p align="justify">Water Polo is a challenging sport that demands discipline and resilience from players, as it involves developing efficacy in swimming,  ball-possession skills and shooting accuracy. At SAJC Water Polo, both our Boys and Girls teams train hard with the aim of having a competitive edge over others. Our Girls team has made our College proud and emerged 2nd at the 2023 National School Games ‘A’ Division Water Polo Competitions, while our Boys team was placed in the Top 4.</p>
<p align="justify">We welcome anyone who wishes to take on a new challenge to join the SAJC’s Water Polo Team! No experience in the sport is needed but students who wish to join the sport must basic swimming skills. </p>
<p align="justify">Our weekly trainings are on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5 to 7:30pm, next door at the Saint Andrew’s Village pool.</p>

<p align="justify">At SAJC Football, we aim to always put our best boot forward in whatever we do. Through our shared passion for football, both our Girls and Boys teams have done the College proud! In the most recent National School Games 'A' Division Football Competitions in 2019 and 2022, our Girls team attained the 1st runners-up position in both years while the Boys team were Champions in 2019 and 1st runners-up in 2022.</p>
<p align="justify">Our training days take place two to three times a week. No prior experience is required. We welcome anyone with a positive attitude and a heart for the sport to apply!</p>

<p align="justify">At SAJC Football, we aim to always put our best boot forward in whatever we do. Through our shared passion for football, both our Girls and Boys teams have done the College proud! In the recent National School Games 'A' Division Football Competitions in 2022 and 2023, our Girls team attained the 1st and 2nd runners-up positions while the Boys team were 1st runners-up in both years.</p>
<p align="justify">Our training days take place two to three times a week. No prior experience is required. We welcome anyone with a positive attitude and a heart for the sport to apply!</p>

<p align="justify">The Saint Andrew&rsquo;s Netball (SANB) family is made up of a group of players who are passionate about netball and are keen to learn more about the sport. Besides our CCA training sessions, some of our SANB highlights include playing at the Daisy Tan and Pesta Sukan Carnivals. SANB players are also given the opportunity to represent the College in the National School Games and participate in an annual team trip to Kuala Lumpur. We are proud to say that SANB has achieved Top 8 at the &lsquo;A&rsquo; Divisions.</p>
<p align="justify">Our training days are on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Additionally, we also have a strength and conditioning session every week. If you have any experience with the sport, and have the interest and passion to play, come join the SANB family!</p>

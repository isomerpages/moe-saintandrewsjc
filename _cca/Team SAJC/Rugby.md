<p align="justify">Here at SAJC, rugby forms an integral part of the St Andrew’s Village culture. Rugby is a traditional sport that has been played by many generations of St Andrew’s boys. While rugby is considered a gentleman’s sport, it is also known for its physicality and action. Some of our achievements include coming in Top 3 for the National School Games ‘A’ Division Rugby Competition in 2019.</p>
<p align="justify">Training days are on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. We welcome anyone who is interested in the sport! But be prepared -- you’re in for some serious exercise.</p>

<p>Focusing on both mental and physical training, Ultimate Frisbee is a demanding but rewarding sport. At Saints Ultimate (SAU), we do more than just throwing a Frisbee around&ndash; we also learn to appreciate the physics behind the sport, and what it means to be a good sportsman. Working together as a co-ed team, SAU strongly believes in love, tenacity and chasing after excellence. Our team aims to make Ultimate Frisbee a more recognised and loved sport in Singapore. Carrying the motto &ldquo;Learn, Laugh, Love&rdquo;, we hope to make every training enjoyable and enriching!</p>
<p>Our trainings are held twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday. SAU welcomes anyone who is willing to learn and have a passion for Ultimate Frisbee. Remember, there is no SAU without &lsquo;U&rsquo;!</p>

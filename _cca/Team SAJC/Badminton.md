<p>The SAJC Badminton Team aims to sharpen our skills consistently in order
to play competitively at any tournament. Our trainings focus on the following
aspects: footwork, fitness, speed, accuracy, strategies and control. We
emphasise on three core values in order to grow as a team: teamwork, sportsmanship,
and resilience.</p>
<p>Through our rigorous training sessions and the bond we have with one another,
we hope to improve our skills, strengthen our value of sportsmanship and
promote team spirit! Youâ€™ll find us hard at work during training sessions
on Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>

<p>Saints&rsquo; Touch Rugby is a CCA that strives to cultivate team spirit, dedication, responsibility and integrity in our players. As a sport, it requires a combination of strategic thinking, fitness and agility. Unlike rugby, touch rugby is a non-contact sport. Instead of tackling, we use touches to gain possession of the ball.</p>
<p>All of our members enter the CCA with no prior experience, so everyone starts on a level playing field. Our training days are on Wednesdays and Fridays. If you&rsquo;re looking for an incredibly fun sport with an opportunity to forge deep, valuable connections, this is the sport for you!</p>

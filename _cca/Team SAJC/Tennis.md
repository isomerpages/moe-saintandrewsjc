<p>The SAJC Tennis Boys’ and Girls’ teams share a common love for the sport
and strive to do our best on court. During trainings, we practice drills
to hone our racquet skills and play in matches to develop physical and
mental resilience. We also play at our best in the annual National School
Games competitions.</p>
<p>Our training days are on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. If you are
someone with a passion and dedication for tennis, we hope to create an
enjoyable and memorable experience with you!</p>

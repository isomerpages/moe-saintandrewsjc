<p>At the SAJC Concert Band, we believe that music-making should be enjoyable
and only then, would it be entertaining and uplifting for our audiences.
We know that by working together as a tight-knitted Band, we are growing
together both in our musical excellence and character. Besides participating
in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival, the Band also organises annual
performances to feature our hard work and progress to family and friends.</p>
<p>The Band is conducted by our well-loved Conductor Mr Marvin Khoo, who
graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, USA, with a Bachelor
of Music (Jazz Composition).</p>

<p>The Saints Chorale is a place that allows each member to nurture a greater sense of musicality, through singing and performing opportunities. From sacred to jazz, German to Latin, chorale music covers different music genres and languages, and we&rsquo;re here to experience them all!</p>
<p>Regardless of having a musical background or not, we welcome anyone that has a passion for singing. Our CCA sessions are held on Wednesdays and Fridays, when you&rsquo;ll hear our voices ringing around campus.</p>

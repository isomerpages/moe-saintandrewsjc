<p align="justify">The SAJC Guitar Ensemble aims to teach its members how to learn and play the guitar together, while creating worthwhile friendships along the way. Members are provided with opportunities to develop their skills through sectional practices, and will also get to showcase their hard work at the annual Guitar Festival and biennial Singapore Youth Festival. We were recently awarded the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2021.</p>
<p align="justify">We warmly welcome anyone who is passionate about playing the guitar. No prior experience is required as you will be guided to handle the instrument from the very start! You can meet us on Tuesdays and Fridays to find out more.</p>

<p align="justify">Saints Advocate is a Student Leadership CCA that aims to promote awareness and advocate changes for worthy social causes by interacting directly with members of the community. Some of our student-initiated projects include advocating for the welfare of migrant workers, raising awareness of mental health issues and advocating for the dignity and rights of the physically or mentally challenged community. We also organise other College-wide advocacy events such as Friendship Week and Project Acknowledgement. Essentially, we go beyond service because we influence others to serve alongside us.</p>
<p align="justify">We meet on Wednesdays and Fridays. If you have a heart and calling to serve the larger community, come join us!</p>

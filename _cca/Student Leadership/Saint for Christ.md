<p align="justify">Members of Saints For Christ (SFC) act as the spiritual leaders of SAJC, where we focus on knowing Christ and making him known. SFC connects with our fellow Saints through organising events such as Life Concert and Mission Week, reaching out to global communities through service learning, and serving in Morning Worship and Scripture Reading. Together with our fellow student leadership body, we contribute to the vibrancy of College life. We are more than just a CCA &ndash; we are a family!</p>
<p>SFC meetings are held on Wednesdays and Fridays, and we hope to see you there!</p>

<p align="justify">The Student Council serves the college through planning and executing major college-based events such as Teachers&rsquo; Day, Open House and the JC1 Orientation. It also acts as the bridge between the student body and the school by gathering feedback from students and sharing them with the school leaders. The Student Council of SAJC also strives to create a conducive and vibrant school environment by organising interactive online and offline activities throughout the year!</p>
<p align="justify">To be a part of the SAJC Student Council, students will first undergo a mentoring period where they will learn about servant leadership and important leadership skills. Shortlisted nominees will then campaign for votes in the Student Council Elections, where the student body will elect suitable student leaders to serve the school. Finally, successful Elects will go through Commendation where they will officially become the Student Councillors of the college.</p>
<p align="justify">Our CCA Sessions are held twice a week, on Wednesday and Friday.</p>

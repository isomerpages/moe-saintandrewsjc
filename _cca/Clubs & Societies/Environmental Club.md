<p>The SAJC Environment Club aims to promote sustainable development and encourage Saints to do their part in caring for the environment. We meet to discuss environmental issues, and prepare for upcoming competitions. Our CCA achievements include the Singapore Audit Award Yellow Flame (2017-2019), Green School South East (2018-2019), Encouragement Award for Sembcorp Green Wave 2019 and 2nd place in the Land Transport Authority 2040 Master Plan Competition 2019. Of course, we act on what we know too, and participate in outdoor environmental activities such as the Kallang River Clean-Up and Tree Planting Day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to find like-minded individuals who value the environment we live in, join us on Wednesdays!</p>

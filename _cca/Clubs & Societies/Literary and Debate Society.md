<p align="justify">The SAJC Literary and Debating Society aims for its members to master both speaking and writing skills. Through debating sessions held during CCA, our members are exposed to a myriad of topics about the world we live in. We apply the skills that we are taught during our training sessions to Debate competitions that are held locally and internationally. Our Society also runs the school publication, IOTA, in which they pen about a wide variety of topics they are passionate about.</p>
<p>We meet every Wednesday and Friday and hope that you can join us!&nbsp;</p>

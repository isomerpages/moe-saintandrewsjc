<p align="justify">Interested in coding but not sure where to start? Come and join the Info Comm Club where students with a passion for coding come together to explore various coding courses in the field of app-making, data science, and Arduino. Our Club believes in self-directed learning and does not rely on a coach. We learn from members sharing their knowledge, and our exposure to many competitions such as the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI), SMU Whitehacks, Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp by DSTA and Cyberthon.</p>
<p align="justify">Youâ€™re invited to come join us every Wednesday!</p>

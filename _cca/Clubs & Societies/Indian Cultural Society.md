<p>The SAJC Indian Cultural Society (ICS) consists of three teams: Dance, Debate and Writing. Members are free to join any section they wish to be a part of. The Society aims to encourage interest and appreciation of the complexity and uniqueness of the Tamil language and culture in its members. It also serves as a platform for members to know more about their cultural roots, and forge new friendships with their fellow members!</p>
<p>Members of ICS are given the opportunity to participate in various competitions and workshops, ranging from performance, to debate, and creative writing. We also educate non-Indian students in College about our culture to promote social cohesion among different races in SAJC. Our captivating performances for annual events like Teachers&rsquo; Day is just one of the ways we do this!</p>
<p>Want to find out more? Come and meet us every Friday!</p>

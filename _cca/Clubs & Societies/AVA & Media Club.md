<p align="justify">The SAJC AVA &amp; Media Club serves the College by ensuring the smooth operations and success of school events and programmes that require any audio and visual aid, as well as recording pivotal moments of our achievements. Most of what we do takes place behind the scenes, as our role covers filming, video editing, and managing the public announcement (PA) system for SAJC. The Club and its members strive to provide the best support to almost every event throughout the school year, from the JC1 Orientation to the Annual College Day. Every member is also given opportunities to produce official College videos and to participate in national competitions. Working in small but committed teams, our members have a strong sense of unity.</p>
<p>Join us on Wednesdays for our training sessions and Club meetings!</p>

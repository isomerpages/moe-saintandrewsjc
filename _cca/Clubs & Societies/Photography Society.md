<p>The SAJC Photographic Society is a home for those with a burning passion for photography and for those who aspire to hone and showcase their photography skills. As the saying goes, &ldquo;A picture paints a thousand words&rdquo; and so we use our pictures to capture special moments of the SAJC experience! Members of the Photographic Society get to learn the basics of photography as well as more advanced skills covering composition techniques and photo editing.</p>
<p>Join the SAJC Photographic Society if you wish to have an empowering experience of capturing the SAJC family at its best, through your lens.</p>

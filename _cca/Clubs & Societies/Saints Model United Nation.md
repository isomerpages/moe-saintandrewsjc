<p align="justify">The Saints Model United Nations (MUN) Club allows members to build up the necessary skills for any MUN conference. Held every Wednesday, the Saints MUN Club allows each member to cultivate an interest in global affairs through lively discussions and debates. We help members to gain the confidence to speak and exchange information, regardless of platform and media. By simulating a United Nations conference, members will have the opportunity to discuss a variety of global issues, while being able to broaden their worldview. Additionally, members will be able to hone their research and critical thinking skills. We look forward to planning and participating in the annual Saints MUN Conference, and of course, to participating in external conferences too!</p>
<p align="justify">If youâ€™ve got your eye on global affairs, the Saints MUN Club is your place to be.</p>

<p align="justify">The Saints Sports Club provides sporting opportunities for leisure. In essence, we play sports simply because we enjoy them!</p>
<p align="justify">We aim to provide our members an exposure to a variety of sports such as ultimate frisbee, badminton and volleyball. Besides playing sports, we also seek to develop a spirit of excellence in each member. This is done through participating in external sports events such as charity runs. In addition, we also collaborate with the College&rsquo;s PE Department to organise College-wide sporting events, such as the Steps to Care Challenge. This develops members as community builders, not only because we are serving the wider College community, but also because these events place social causes, like raising awareness for the autism community, in the spotlight.</p>
<p align="justify">Want to have fun and get fit at the same time? Join us for our sessions on Wednesdays!</p>

<p align="justify">The SAJC Outdoor Activities Club (ODAC) cultivates the spirit of adventure and risk-taking, independence and resilience through outdoor education and experiential learning. As the natural environment is seen to be everyone’s ‘playground’, members develop an awareness and appreciation of the environment over time, and actively involve themselves in its conservation.</p>
<p align="justify">Annually, SAJC ODAC goes on an overseas expedition which incorporates an overseas service learning component. To tighten our engagement with community needs, we also participate in at least one race for a cause every year.</p>
<p align="justify">Up for an adventure? Join us for our sessions each Wednesday and Friday!</p>

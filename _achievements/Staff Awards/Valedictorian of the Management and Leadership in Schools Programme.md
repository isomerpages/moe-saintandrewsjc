<p>Congratulations to our Head of Department for the Economics Department, Ms Shawna Lim for her graduation from the Management and Leadership in Schools (MLS) programme!</p>
<p>She was also conferred with the Dr Ruth Wong Medal, which is awarded to the participant who demonstrates the best overall performance in the MLS programme.</p>
<p>In her valedictorian speech, she reflected on how the programme has equipped her to thrive in this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world and has a word of encouragement for her fellow educators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we continue to grow together as educators and leaders, we will inevitably face challenges. But if we are resilient and determined, and harness the collective strength of our networks, we can rise above the challenges in a VUCA world and overcome!&rdquo;</p>

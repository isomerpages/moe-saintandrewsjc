<p>Last week, we took time as a college to celebrate the success of our JC1s Saints in the recent Common Test. As a cohort, the students have done well, which is a testament to how well they have adapted and integrated into the Saints family.</p>
<p>While we recognise the students who have been awarded the CT Commendation Award, we would also like to acknowledge the good efforts of all JC1s, we are so proud of you!</p>

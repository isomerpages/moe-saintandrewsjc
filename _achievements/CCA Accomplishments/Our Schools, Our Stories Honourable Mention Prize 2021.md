<p>Kenan Chin and Amelia Yew of the Photographic Society are honoured to be given the opportunity to showcase photos they have taken in this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Our Schools, Our Stories&rsquo; exhibitions. These photos have also won the Honourable Mention prize under the Youth category- Priceless Moments theme.</p>
<p>Inspired by the new friendships formed following the JC1 orientation, &lsquo;A New Chapter&rsquo; captures the last bastion of secondary school ebullience before the plunge into the Junior College journey. Despite the restrictions, utmost effort was put in to ensure that the JC1 orientation was a success. The juniors, although initially shy and nervous, eventually warmed up to one another through small group face-to-face and online segments. Kenan and Amelia hope that through these photos, they have captured the priceless, fleeting moments as a recollection of the strong school spirit.</p>

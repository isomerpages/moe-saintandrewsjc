<p>As canoeists, we emphasise strength and endurance in the form of running, circuits as well as gym, and water training. We offer a balanced programme between land and water training, which strives to bring out the best in each of us. SAJC Canoeing strives to nurture all-rounded student-athletes. Besides academic excellence, we value commitment and dedication to holistic development. With discipline and determination, you can expect to grow stronger physically as well as mentally.</p>
<p>We are looking for positive and open-minded individuals! Come and meet us on our CCA training days on Monday (land training), Wednesday and Saturday (water training).</p>

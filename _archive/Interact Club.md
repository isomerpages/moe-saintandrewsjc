<p>SAJC Interactors come together to brainstorm service plans, challenge ideas, and engage our beneficiaries (Lion&rsquo;s Befrienders Bendemeer and Fei Yue Family Centre) in a series of creative programmes and events. In the true spirit of &ldquo;Service Above Self&rdquo;, we go beyond language barriers and intergenerational differences to reach out to whoever we serve. Some key Club programmes include the College&rsquo;s annual Blood Donation Drive and Japan Exchange Programme. In the current climate, we have continued to ramp up advocacy efforts through online engagement, and persist in promoting the message of selflessness and compassion in all that we do.</p>
<p>Join us for our CCA sessions on Wednesdays and Fridays! It&rsquo;ll be an experience that will give you both purpose and passion.</p>

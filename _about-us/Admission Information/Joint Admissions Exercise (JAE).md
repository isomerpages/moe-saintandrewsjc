<p align="justify">Students with Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination Results may apply for admission into the college via the Ministry of Education Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE). The JAE is typically conducted in January after the release of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination results. The JAE is conducted in three phases:</p>

*   Registration Phase
*   Posting Phase
*   Posting Results Release Phase

More information on the JAE process can be found on the **[MOE Admissions](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae)** website.

Information on appeals into the college will be published on the college website near the release of JAE posting results.

<p align="justify">Applicants seeking to gain admission into the college must meet the entry criteria based on the L1R5 aggregate. This aggregate is calculated from the results obtained in the previous year’s Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:&nbsp;<br></strong>St Andrew's Junior College (SAJC)
has its origins in St Andrew's School, which was founded in 1862 by the
Anglican Diocese of Singapore. SAJC is an aided mission school which was
started as a vision of faith when the Anglican Church took up the challenge
of building a junior college in line with national educational developments
in the 1970’s. The Lutheran and Presbyterian Churches also joined in the
building project. The College began in 1978.</p>
<p>SAJC is a two-year co-educational institution that takes in top students
from the year's cohort finishing their Singapore-Cambridge General Certification
of Education (GCE) at Ordinary ‘O’ level (the equivalent to Year 10). The
College prepares these students for the Singapore-Cambridge General Certification
of Education at Advanced ‘A’ level.</p>
<p>The College’s vision is to be a Home of Servant Leaders who bring life
to the Nations. The College believes in nurturing Saints who are principled
servant-leaders, upholding the WISE<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;and TRUE<sup>[2]&nbsp;</sup>values
that define who we are and how we act when we stand together as a village.</p>
<p>Besides attaining academic success, its students also excel in co-curricular
activities. Many of the sports regularly attain the top 4 positions at
the national championship competitions. The performing arts groups also
clinch&nbsp;distinction&nbsp;awards at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts
Presentation. In addition, the students make an indelible impact in serving
the less fortunate and needy members of the communities, both locally and
overseas. All in all, its students enjoy an exceptionally high quality
education during their years in the College.</p>

<p><strong>Tutors:<br></strong><u>Civics Tutor&nbsp;</u>: The Civics Tutor
is the teacher who would know his/her student best. He/She is the equivalent
of the home/form teacher. The Civics Tutor usually tutors the student for
at least one subject, will also compile the student's academic and other
records. The Civics Tutor caters to the pastoral needs of the students

is needed. Every class has Civics Tutor Advisor, who lends support in caring
for the student's well-being.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) aims to acknowledge teachers in our schools
who go beyond the call of duty, nurturing the holistic development of their
students and ensuring their charges grow up to be confident, independent,
and resilient learners for our nation - <a href="cta.nie.edu.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NIE CTA 2024</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At SAJC we believe that education is about more than just academic excellence
- it is about fostering a nurturing and supportive environment where every
student can thrive. Indeed, no one is here by chance, and every Saint can
be continually empowered to reach their potential.</p>

<p>With the implementation of tightened SMMs, the annual National Schools Games was called to a halt and ended the CCA season for our CCAs. Nonetheless, Tenpin Bowling and 4 performing arts groups had completed their respective competitions. The aforementioned CCAs presented their awards and trophies to our Principal, Mr Tham, in separate presentation sessions.</p>
<p>Apart from these, the Environment Club was awarded the Certificate of Appreciation for Community in Nature Schools Awards 2020. The Badminton teams have yet to complete their matches in the group stages of the competition while the Tennis teams have just embarked on the Quarter Finals.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all School leaders, Teachers,Coaches, Instructors and Parents for the continuous support and encouragement. Up and on!</p>

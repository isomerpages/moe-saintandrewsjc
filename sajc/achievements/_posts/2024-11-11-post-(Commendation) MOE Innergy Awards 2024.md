<p>The MOE Innergy Awards and Outstanding Innovator Awards (OIA) 2024 recognises
and honours teams and individuals for impactful innovations that enhance
teaching and learning in our schools. We are proud to announce that our
school's <em>Teh Tarik!</em> professional sharing platform was awarded the <strong>Commendation Award</strong> for
enhancing work processes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Teh Tarik!</em> is a monthly ground-up sharing platform for teachers
to conduct an introductory or enrichment session on any areas pertaining
to Teaching and Learning Practices, and Professional Well-being. The aim
is to spark or deepen interest in teachers on areas that may further extend
to the formation of formal professional learning teams and/or informal
interest groups.</p>
<p>Hence, it is not only about reaching for knowledge, expertise or interest
but also about self-development through on-going active learning as well
as building camaraderie. <em>Teh Tarik!</em> is intentionally designed to
be light-hearted and conversational in style so that teachers feel more
relaxed and comfortable to conduct and attend the sessions in an assuring
and cheerful environment.</p>
<p>Kudos to the team behind <em>Teh Tarik!</em> and all presenters who have
contributed to the learning community at SAJC! Congratulations!</p>

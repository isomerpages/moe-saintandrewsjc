<p>SAJCâ€™s Valedictorian for 2021 is Tham Si Hui Charis. As the President
of the 42nd Student Council, Charis was actively involved in helming many
different school activities. Charis has been awarded the MOE Teaching Award
and will be pursuing her studies at NTU-NIE in August 2021.</p>
<p>Below is her sharing at the 44th College Day. It is an important testimony
of how the Saints family supported each other during the start of the Covid-19
pandemic and a reminder to all Saints to continue to serve the community
in the coming days.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce the success of the inaugural Youth Bilingual
Discourse (JCCI), which took place on Saturday, August 3rd, at the National
Library, in collaboration with the National Library Board.</p>
<p>This landmark event brought together over 100 students from 11 JCCI institutions,
who engaged in thought-provoking discussions on bilingualism and the future
of Mother Tongue languages. The forum explored the dual impact of artificial
intelligence (AI) on Mother Tongue languages and the various challenges
they face.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker was Madam Rahayu Mahzam, Minister of State, Ministry
of Digital Development and Information &amp; Ministry of Health. Madam
Rahayu spoke on the discussion theme: ‘Celebrating Diversity and Inclusivity
through Bilingualism for a Sustainable Future’, which set the direction
for the group conversations in English followed by the respective Mother
Tongue languages.</p>
<p>Participants expressed deep appreciation for the dynamic exchanges, which
allowed them to build on each other’s arguments and reach a consensus on
various issues. For instance, the discussion on AI’s impact on Mother Tongue
languages highlighted the unique nuances and paralinguistic features inherent
in human interaction—underscoring that AI should be viewed as a supportive
tool rather than a replacement for human communication.</p>
<p>The discourse on challenges facing Mother Tongue languages revealed a
collective belief in the positive, synergistic potential of bilingualism
in Singapore. Participants recognized that learning two languages and their
associated value systems strengthens character and fosters a more inclusive
society.</p>
<p>Moreover, attendees were heartened to discover a shared passion for their
Mother Tongue languages, reinforcing a sense of community and mutual support.</p>
<p>The event successfully elevated participants’ engagement in both English
and their Mother Tongue languages, fostering richer dialogues and expanding
networking opportunities among students from higher educational institutions,
all within a vibrant, safe, and interactive environment.</p>

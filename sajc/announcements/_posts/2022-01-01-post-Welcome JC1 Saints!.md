<p>Welcome to SAJC! Look out for a WhatsApp message from your Orientation Group Leaders today afternoon!</p>
<p>If you have&nbsp;<strong>flu-like symptoms (e.g. sore throat, runny nose) or fever at or above 38 &deg;C</strong>, please do not report to SAJC, even if your ART result is negative. Instead, you are encouraged to see a doctor.</p>
<p>If you have been issued a&nbsp;<strong>MC</strong>, please stay at home for the entire duration of your MC.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<strong>you have tested positive for Covid-19,&nbsp;</strong>please inform the college and do not come to school. (Contact details are provided below.)</p>
<p>If you have&nbsp;<strong>household members who have tested positive for Covid-19</strong>, please self-administer ART every morning and ensure that your test results are negative and that you have no flu-like symptoms before you come to school.</p>
<p>If you are unable to report to SAJC for the above reasons on 7 Feb, please call SAJC at 6285 7008 or email SAJC at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sajc@moe.edu.sg">sajc@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;to confirm your place in the school. You will be advised on further steps to take.</p>

<p>In its inaugural year, the programme offered a multi-dimensional journey
that immersed students in the pillars of culture, education, economy, and
technology. This provided the students with a rich real-world experience.
Students don’t merely study about China’s heritage rather they lived it,
interacted with it, and deeply engaged with its history and progress. They
also explored China’s technological innovations and booming economy, gaining
valuable insights into a rapidly evolving global landscape.</p>

<p>This experiential learning opportunity encouraged personal growth through
cultural immersion and fostered a profound understanding of global forces
while equipping students with practical skills. Hands-on activities like
crafting and tea-making deepened their appreciation for Chinese traditions,
while visits to local schools inspired reflections on discipline, community,
and personal growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through their exploration of China’s economic and technological advances,
students gained insights into entrepreneurship, innovation, robotics, AI,
and smart cities, sparking curiosity about future-forward industries. Ultimately,
the programme built confidence, independence, and meaningful connections,
fostering a sense of community and self-discovery that lasts a lifetime.</p>

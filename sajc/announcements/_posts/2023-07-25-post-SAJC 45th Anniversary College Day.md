Dear Saints,

We would like to wish you all a blessed 45th Anniversary College Day. The college has put together a special E-Booklet to acknowledge those who have done our school proud in various ways, achieving academic excellence and exemplifying the spirit of Servant Leadership. You can download the E-Booklet and the Principal’s Report using the links below.

The College has also put together a special video montage to highlight the SAJC scholarships and the motivational comments from the recipients. Let’s hear from our awardees and be inspired by them. Keeping the flame burning brightly ever!

<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Biology?</strong></h4><p>The H2 Biology syllabus places emphasis on the applications of biology and the impact of recent developments on the needs of contemporary society. Experimental work is an important component and should underpin the teaching and learning of biology. The value of learning H2 Biology ultimately hinges on the development of a scientific mind and disposition while addressing the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained. Through the study of the H2 Biology course, students will be prepared for life science-related courses at university and, consequently, careers that are related to this field.</p><h4><strong>2.

<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Physics?</strong></h4>
<p>‘A’ Level Physics has been designed to expand on the content coverage
from the ‘O’ Levels. Studying Physics at the A Levels enables students
to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the
challenges of the 21st century, and to develop in them the understanding,
skills, ethics and attitude relevant to the Practices of Science. Physics
also develops in students an understanding that a small number of basic
principles and core ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve
problems for a variety of systems in the physical world.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is Physics taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>There will be lectures (online or face-to-face) that students must attend
where content will be taught. Demonstrations, mathematical derivations
and the underlying physical intuition will be shared during the lecture.
After attending the lectures, physics tutors will reinforce the understanding
and application of these concepts during tutorials through solving physics
problems. Practical skills (for H2 Physics only) will be taught in the
lab via hands-on experiences.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Physics?</strong></h4>
<p>Students will need to ensure they have a strong foundation for ‘O’ Level
Physics in order to build new knowledge over that base. It would be essential
for students to approach the subject beyond just memorising equations but
to link physics concepts to real life observations, make logical deduction
based on evidence such as experimental data and communicate using precise
scientific terminology. Students should also hone their problem solving
skills making it explicit for themselves how they analyse a problem, apply
appropriate concepts and make use of mathematical techniques skilfully
to work out the solutions.</p>

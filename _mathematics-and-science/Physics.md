<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Physics?</strong></h4><p>‘A’ Level Physics has been designed to expand on the content coverage from the ‘O’ Levels. Studying Physics at the A Levels enables students to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century, and to develop in them the understanding, skills, ethics and attitude relevant to the Practices of Science. Physics also develops in students an understanding that a small number of basic principles and core ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems for a variety of systems in the physical world.</p><h4><strong>2. How is Physics taught at SAJC?</strong></h4><p>There will be lectures (online or face-to-face) that students must attend where content will be taught. Demonstrations, mathematical derivations and the underlying physical intuition will be shared during the lecture. After attending the lectures, physics tutors will reinforce the understanding and application of these concepts during tutorials through solving physics problems. Practical skills (for H2 Physics only) will be taught in the lab via hands-on experiences.</p><h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Physics?</strong></h4><p>Students will need to ensure they have a strong foundation for ‘O’ Level Physics in order to build new knowledge over that base. It would be essential for students to approach the subject beyond just memorising equations but to link physics concepts to real life observations, make logical deduction based on evidence such as experimental data and communicate using precise scientific terminology. Students should also hone their problem solving skills making it explicit for themselves how they analyse a problem, apply appropriate concepts and make use of mathematical techniques skilfully to work out the solutions.</p><p></p><p>For more information about Physics, please refer to the <a href="/files/2024/SAJC_Prospectus_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 College Prospectus.</a></p><p></p><p>You may also visit the following SEAB website for the detailed syllabus information.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2024syllabus/8867_y24_sy.pdf"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/QR Codes/H1_PHY_QR.png"></a></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2024syllabus/9749_y24_sy.pdf"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/QR Codes/H2_PHY_QR.png"></a></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2022syllabus/9814_y22_sy.pdf"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/QR Codes/H3_Phy.png"></a></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

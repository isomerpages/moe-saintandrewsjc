<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Further Mathematics?</strong></h4><p>H2 Further Mathematics (FM) is designed for students who are mathematically-inclined and who intend to specialize in mathematics, sciences or engineering or disciplines with higher demand on mathematical skills. It extends and expands on the range of mathematics and statistics topics in H2 Mathematics and provides these students with a head start in learning a wider range of mathematical methods and tools that are useful for solving more complex problems in mathematics and statistics. H2 FM is to be offered together with H2 Math as a double Mathematics course.</p><p></p><p>For more information about H2 Further Mathematics, please refer to the <a href="/files/2024/SAJC_Prospectus_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 College Prospectus.</a></p><p></p><p>You may also visit the following SEAB website for the detailed syllabus information.</p><p></p><p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2024syllabus/9649_y24_sy.pdf"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/QR Codes/H2_FM_QR.png"></a><p></p>

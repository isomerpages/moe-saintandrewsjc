<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Further Mathematics?</strong></h4>
<p>H2 Further Mathematics (FM) is designed for students who are mathematically-inclined
and who intend to specialize in mathematics, sciences or engineering or
disciplines with higher demand on mathematical skills. It extends and expands
on the range of mathematics and statistics topics in H2 Mathematics and
provides these students with a head start in learning a wider range of
mathematical methods and tools that are useful for solving more complex
problems in mathematics and statistics. H2 FM is to be offered together
with H2 Math as a double Mathematics course.</p>

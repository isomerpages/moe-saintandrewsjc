<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level H2 Mathematics?</strong></h4>
<p>H2 Mathematics is designed to prepare students with the required content
and skills for courses on science and engineering related courses, where
a good foundation in mathematics is required. It develops mathematical
thinking and reasoning skills that are essential for further learning of
mathematics. Through real world application of mathematics, students are
also able to develop an appreciation of the usefulness of Mathematics in
Science and Engineering fields.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is H2 Mathematics taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>The lessons for H2 Mathematics are conducted in the lecture-tutorial style.
Content teaching and demonstrations on the application of the skills required
in a particular topic are presented in a lecture. In a smaller class setting,
namely the tutorials, tutors will discuss with the class on how to approach
and solve the various mathematics questions. All students are required
to purchase a Graphing Calculator which is a learning tool for H2 Math.
Students are expected to be proficient in the use of Graphing Calculator
in solving Mathematics problems.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for H2 Mathematics?</strong></h4>
<p>You will need to adopt a consistent approach towards the learning of H2
Mathematics. Students are expected to be well prepared for tutorials, to
be proactive in seeking clarifications from subject tutors and disciplined
in setting time aside to practice solving problems, to ensure mastery of
concepts and skills. Last but not least, students are expected to think
critically and be able to articulate their learning using proper mathematical
language and solve the problems with logical reasoning.</p>

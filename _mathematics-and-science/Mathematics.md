It develops mathematical thinking and reasoning skills that are essential for further learning of mathematics. Through real world application of mathematics, students are also able to develop an appreciation of the usefulness of Mathematics in Science and Engineering fields.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is H2 Mathematics taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>The lessons for H2 Mathematics are conducted in the lecture-tutorial style. Content teaching and demonstrations on the application of the skills required in a particular topic are presented in a lecture. In a smaller class setting, namely the tutorials, tutors will discuss with the class on how to approach and solve the various mathematics questions. All students are required to purchase a Graphing Calculator which is a learning tool for H2 Math. Students are expected to be proficient in the use of Graphing Calculator in solving Mathematics problems.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for H2 Mathematics?</strong></h4>
<p>You will need to adopt a consistent approach towards the learning of H2 Mathematics. Students are expected to be well prepared for tutorials, to be proactive in seeking clarifications from subject tutors and disciplined in setting time aside to practice solving problems, to ensure mastery of concepts and skills.

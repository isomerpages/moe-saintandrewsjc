<h4><strong>1. What is â€˜Aâ€™ Level Chemistry?</strong></h4>
<p>Chemistry focuses on the study of matter at the atomic and molecular levels,
examining its structure, properties, and transformations. It bridges physics,
which explains the behavior of particles like atoms and electrons, and
biology, providing insights into molecular interactions and reactions in
biological systems.</p>
<p>Through studying A Level Chemistry, students develop an understanding
of the chemical concepts and how these concepts are inter-related to each
other within Chemistry as well as to other scientific disciplines. Students
also have opportunities to learn about real-world applications of the chemistry
concepts covered in the course, the impact of chemistry on our society
and environment through up-to-date contexts such as those relating to Environmental
Sustainability and Materials, and the contribution of chemistry in addressing
challenges in these contexts. The A Level Chemistry curriculum also aims
to develop scientific literacy in our students through the acquisition
and application of core chemistry knowledge and science practices and values
in daily life, society and the environment.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is H1 and H2 Chemistry taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Complete lecture notes are provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H2 lectures are recorded and screencasts will be available online while
H1 lessons are conducted face-to-face in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The format for tutorials follows as such:
<br>Self-check questions ðŸ¡ª Discussion questions ðŸ¡ª Assignment questions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide comprehensive and step-by-step approaches to unpacking difficult
concepts and topics by making use of the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Step-by-step instructions to guide students in problem solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concise yet detailed summary worksheets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flowcharts and concept maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criteria of success listed to guide students in their answering techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revision packages that are organised into topical, integrated, and full
papers for students to level up gradually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Practicals (<strong>for H2 Chemistry only</strong>) â€“ we offer a rich
range of experiments for students to gain valuable experience. You will
get to carry out most of the major organic distinguishing tests, featuring
striking visual changes such as the silver mirror formation.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Chemistry?</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Listen actively in lectures â€“ highlight key phrases and constantly think
about what is being said. When time is given during lectures to attempt
questions, take part actively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the relevant self-check questions as indicated on the lecture
notes once the lecture content is covered. Once the self-check questions
are complete, check the answers and consult your tutor if you have doubts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you are confident about the self-check questions, move on to the
discussion questions. These will be discussed in tutorials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revise your work periodically. There will be revision packages with suggested
schedules to help you stay on track.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<td>To encourage the students for their mid-year examinations, the PSG committee and parent volunteers come together and prepare approximately 1,800 care packs that are distributed to all SAJC students. Each pack consists of healthy energy snacks and stickers with motivational quotes. This is a wonderful gesture to show our love and support, as they study hard for their exams.</td>
<td>To support and care for students who stay back in school to self-study or consult their tutors during Term 3 in preparation for their &ndash;end-of-year examinations, the PSG, together with the school, provides wholesome meals for 150-200 students every evening during the Night Study Programme. This programme is very well-received by the students.</td>
<td>To pray and intercede for the SAJC students, teachers, leaders, parent volunteers and events, the PPG comes together regularly throughout the year. To join this dynamic group, kindly indicate your interest in the online form for PSG registration (link given below)</td>

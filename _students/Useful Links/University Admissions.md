<ol start="2">
<li><strong>General Requirements for NUS / NTU</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>

Candidates who are unable to fulfil the MT requirement for admission but satisfy all other admission requirements may be admitted on a provisional basis. During their course of study, they will be required to attend the MT course conducted by the University or attain the minimum requirement as listed above by retaking the MT paper at the GCE &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level examination before they are allowed to graduate.</p>

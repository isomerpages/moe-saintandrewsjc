<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Project Work?</strong></h4>
<p>Project Work (PW) aims to provide candidates with the opportunity to synthesise
knowledge from various areas of learning, and critically apply it to real
life situations. The four learning outcomes identify the key areas of learning
of the subject: Knowledge Application, Communication, Collaboration and
Independent Learning. While candidates learn to work in groups, they will
also grow independently through self-reflection and evaluation of their
own work processes. These learning outcomes exist in dynamic interplay
rather than as compartmentalised and distinct categories. The following
detail the learning outcomes for PW:</p>
<p><strong><u>Knowledge Application<br></u></strong>CCandidates will acquire
the ability to make links across different areas of knowledge and to generate,
develop and evaluate ideas and information so as to apply these skills
to the project task.</p>
<p><strong><u>Communication<br></u></strong>Candidates will acquire the skills
to communicate effectively and to present ideas clearly and coherently
to a specific audience in both the written and oral forms.</p>
<p><strong><u>Collaboration<br></u></strong>Candidates will acquire collaborative
skills through working in a team to achieve common goals.</p>
<p><strong><u>Independent Learning<br></u></strong>Candidates will be able
to learn on their own, reflect on their learning and take appropriate action
to improve it.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is Project Work taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>Students work in groups of 4-5 on a chosen project in accordance to the
Project Task (project question) of the year.</p>
<p>There will be PW lectures (online or face-to-face) that students must
attend where relevant skills will be taught. During tutorials, PW tutors
will follow-up with these skills, advising students on their application
of skills in their chosen project.</p>
<p>Students are expected to participate actively in class discussions and
contribute to group work. They are also expected to be self-directed in
research individually and in groups.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Project Work?</strong></h4>
<p>Students are required to read widely on current affairs and have knowledge
about issues in Singapore.</p>
<p>Once a project topic has been determined, students are expected to do
independent research on the topic of their choice. Students will be taught
skills that enable critical and creative thinking and are expected to demonstrate
these abilities.</p>
<p>Students are also expected to commit to attend group meetings, group consultations
with PW tutors and to do their part in group research and report writing.
These will take place outside of lecture and tutorial hours.</p>

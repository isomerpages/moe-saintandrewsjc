<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level Project Work?</strong></h4><p>Project Work (PW) aims to provide candidates with the opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning, and critically apply it to real life situations. The four learning outcomes identify the key areas of learning of the subject: Knowledge Application, Communication, Collaboration and Independent Learning. While candidates learn to work in groups, they will also grow independently through self-reflection and evaluation of their own work processes. These learning outcomes exist in dynamic interplay rather than as compartmentalised and distinct categories. The following detail the learning outcomes for PW:</p><p><strong><u>Knowledge Application<br></u></strong>CCandidates will acquire the ability to make links across different areas of knowledge and to generate, develop and evaluate ideas and information so as to apply these skills to the project task.</p><p><strong><u>Communication<br></u></strong>Candidates will acquire the skills to communicate effectively and to present ideas clearly and coherently to a specific audience in both the written and oral forms.</p><p><strong><u>Collaboration<br></u></strong>Candidates will acquire collaborative skills through working in a team to achieve common goals.</p><p><strong><u>Independent Learning<br></u></strong>Candidates will be able to learn on their own, reflect on their learning and take appropriate action to improve it.</p><h4><strong>2. How is Project Work taught at SAJC?</strong></h4><p>Students work in groups of 4-5 on a chosen project in accordance to the Project Task (project question) of the year.</p><p>There will be PW lectures (online or face-to-face) that students must attend where relevant skills will be taught. During tutorials, PW tutors will follow-up with these skills, advising students on their application of skills in their chosen project.</p><p>Students are expected to participate actively in class discussions and contribute to group work. They are also expected to be self-directed in research individually and in groups.</p><h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for Project Work?</strong></h4><p>Students are required to read widely on current affairs and have knowledge about issues in Singapore.</p><p>Once a project topic has been determined, students are expected to do independent research on the topic of their choice. Students will be taught skills that enable critical and creative thinking and are expected to demonstrate these abilities.</p><p>Students are also expected to commit to attend group meetings, group consultations with PW tutors and to do their part in group research and report writing. These will take place outside of lecture and tutorial hours.</p><p>For more information about Project Work, please refer to the <a href="/files/2024/SAJC_Prospectus_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 College Prospectus.</a></p><p>You may also visit the following SEAB website for the detailed syllabus information.</p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2024syllabus/8882_y24_sy.pdf"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/QR Codes/H1_PW_QR.png"></a><p></p>

<h4><strong>1. What is &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level General Paper?</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">General Paper (GP) aims to develop in students the ability to think critically, to construct cogent arguments and to communicate their ideas using clear, accurate and effective language. General Paper encourages students to explore a range of key issues of global and local significance and provides students with a good foundation to thrive in a fast-changing world. At the end of the course, students should have a broader understanding of the world, and be ready to meet the challenges of higher education and the workplace of the future.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is General Paper taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">The students attend GP lectures (online or face-to-face) where both argumentative skills and content knowledge will be delineated. After attending the lectures, GP tutors will continue practising these skills and demonstrate the application of content knowledge with their students during tutorials. Students are expected to proactively clarify their doubts as well as to participate in class discussions. There will also be curated articles exploring a range of key issues of global and local significance for the students on a weekly basis.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for General Paper?</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">Students will need to read widely on current affairs and be updated on their knowledge about the world; hence, it will be essential for them to read newspapers and commentaries on a regular basis. It will be most helpful for them to download news channel apps on their mobile phones so that they can keep themselves updated on the latest news around the world. Equally important would be for students to always adopt a critical mind to think through the implications of current issues on our own society.</p>

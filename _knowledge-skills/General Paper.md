<h4><strong>1. What is ‘A’ Level General Paper?</strong></h4>
<p>General Paper (GP) aims to develop in students the ability to think critically,
to construct cogent arguments and to communicate their ideas using clear,
accurate and effective language. General Paper encourages students to explore
a range of key issues of global and local significance and provides students
with a good foundation to thrive in a fast-changing world. At the end of
the course, students should have a broader understanding of the world,
and be ready to meet the challenges of higher education and the workplace
of the future.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How is General Paper taught at SAJC?</strong></h4>
<p>The students attend GP lectures (online or face-to-face) where both argumentative
skills and content knowledge will be delineated. After attending the lectures,
GP tutors will continue practising these skills and demonstrate the application
of content knowledge with their students during tutorials. Students are
expected to proactively clarify their doubts as well as to participate
in class discussions. There will also be curated articles exploring a range
of key issues of global and local significance for the students on a weekly
basis.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What can I do to prepare myself for General Paper?</strong></h4>
<p>Students will need to read widely on current affairs and be updated on
their knowledge about the world; hence, it will be essential for them to
read newspapers and commentaries on a regular basis. It will be most helpful
for them to download news channel apps on their mobile phones so that they
can keep themselves updated on the latest news around the world. Equally
important would be for students to always adopt a critical mind to think
through the implications of current issues on our own society.</p>
